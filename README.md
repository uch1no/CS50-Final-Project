### Development
This website was developed with Flask. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were the building blocks. SQLite3 was used to provide database connection to store the exercises downloaded using RapidAPI and other user data (login and exercises favorited).

Data was provided by <a href="https://www.exercisedb.io/" target="_blank">Exercisedb.
